Hamiltonian replica exchange with a confining potential
=======================================================

Simulation of a water tetramer with a harmonic confining potential. Different replicas weight differently the potential.
Drivers should be run as 

$ i-pi-driver -u -h f1 -m qtip4pf &
$ i-pi-driver -u -h f2 -m harm3d -o 1e-3 &
